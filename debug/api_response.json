Currently running on Heroku, eventually AWS\n\u2022 The product: We're building the ultimate suite for Finance teams to manage everything from billing to revenue recognition to subscription metrics, and much more\n\u2022 The way we work:\n\u2022 This is a remote job - work anywhere you want, and in any timezone on earth (or outside earth, whatever).\n\u2022 We are an asynchronous team - we don't do scheduled meetings, and rely on each team member to pick their own schedule and to communicate clearly in writing and with recorded videos. Hear from our co-founder Michelle Lee on what it's like to work asynchronously.\n\u2022 We operate completely autonomously - no one will tell you what to do, we'll just tell you the goals and you will figure out how to work towards them with the rest of the team.\n\u2022 The role you'll play on our team:\n\u2022 You'd be one of the first ten engineers on the team.\n\u2022 You'll work on\n\u2022 Backend: database design and implementation, complex data management problems, API design and implementation, writing tests\n\u2022 Frontend: building features in our react app, HTML/CSS + styled components, building amazing user experiences, writing tests\n\u2022 Frontend and backend: building and iterating on our product, collaborating with designers and founders, and making a product that users will love.\n\u2022 Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.\n\nOur interview process\n\nOur interview process is designed to focus on your skills as a software engineer, and your ability to communicate clearly. We're a fully asynchronous company, so that's how we will communicate in this interview process too \ud83d\ude42.\n\u2022 We'll ask you to work on a small code challenge\n\u2022 After reviewing the short code challenge, we'll ask you to work on a ~90 minute exercise while recording a loom (or other screen recording) video.\n\u2022 If the video interview above goes well, we'll want to learn a bit more about how you communicate in writing - we will ask you to put together a technical design document. This is one of the biggest ways we communicate at Subscript, so we want to see that you can work well with that!\n\nAnd finally, hopefully we'll send you an offer. And hopefully you'll accept!\n\u2022 You're an excellent engineer (you write high quality code, you write great tests, you ship quickly)\n\u2022 You're a great communicator via writing, and via recorded videos.\n\u2022 You're excited about working on a globally-distributed and diverse team, in an incredibly unique culture where autonomy, accountability, and ownership are equally as valued as your skillset.\n\u2022 That's it!\n\u2022 Unlimited vacation\n\u2022 Completely flexible work schedule - work literally anytime (and anywhere) you want!\n\u2022 Benefits appropriate to your location (health/dental/vision in the USA)\n\u2022 Company wide retreats multiple times per year\n\u2022 Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.",
